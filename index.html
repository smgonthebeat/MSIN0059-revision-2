            <h2>1. Overlaps Between the 2021 Exam Paper and the Sample Exam Paper</h2>
            <p>By comparing the 2021 exam with the original sample exam ("Lecture 10 - Sample Exam Paper - without solutions.pdf"), the following topics and question‐styles appear in <em>both</em> papers:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cost Classification & Its Role in Managerial Decisions</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2021 Exam: A1(a) directly discusses the meaning of costs in various contexts.</li>
                        <li>Sample Exam: Often references how "contribution vs. full cost" or "direct vs. indirect cost" plays into decision making (Section A in the sample exam).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Variance Analysis and Budgeting</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2021 Exam: A1(b) specifically addresses the nature of variances and how to interpret "favourable variance." A2 also includes part (b) about budgeting (cash budget for 6 months).</li>
                        <li>Sample Exam: Multiple parts talk about "All variances should be investigated," "flexing the budget," standard cost variances (e.g., in Section A, A1(b)–(d), also in A2 for the sample exam).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Capital Investment Appraisal (NPV, Payback, Possibly IRR)</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2021 Exam: A2 requires net present value (NPV), payback period; B1 compares payback to IRR.</li>
                        <li>Sample Exam: Section A's second big question (A2) also involves NPV with a multi-year project, plus discount tables, cost of capital, residual values, etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Budgeting Systems, Behavioral Implications, and Motivational Issues</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2021 Exam: A2(b) (the second question in A2) references managers' targets, staff motivation, and bonuses. Section B2 also focuses on the role of budgets, limiting factors, etc.</li>
                        <li>Sample Exam: Section B1 is <em>all</em> about the nature, purposes, and behavioral implications of budgeting systems.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Standard Costing & Variance Reconciliation</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2021 Exam: Section C1 is explicitly about standard cost variance analysis, reconciling budgeted vs. actual profit.</li>
                        <li>Sample Exam: Variation of standard costing/variance analysis in sections A1(b)(c)(d) and A2(C) or (D).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Break‐Even / CVP Analysis</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>2021 Exam: Section C2 is a dedicated break-even question (calculating contribution margin, margin of safety, new branch, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Sample Exam: CVP was also fundamental to "contribution" and "marginal costing" discussions (Week 4 in your notes). The sample exam doesn't have a big dedicated break-even question but <em>does</em> test marginal costing in short‐term decisions, so the principle is repeated.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Thus, the common repeated themes across <em>both</em> exams—and hence crucial for your revision—are:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Cost classification and relevance (e.g., which costs matter for decisions).</li>
                <li>NPV / capital investment calculations.</li>
                <li>Budgeting and variance analysis (including the nature of "favourable/adverse" variances).</li>
                <li>Behavioral aspects of budgeting (motivation, target‐setting).</li>
                <li>Standard costing (material, labour, overhead variances).</li>
                <li>Marginal costing, CVP, and break-even considerations.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>These repeated items <em>do</em> show up in both papers. So you'll want to prioritize mastering them for your <em>real</em> exam.</p>

                <p>"Honest Diamonds Ltd (HD) is considering investing in a new project to extract diamonds from a newly found source located in caves in Australia.
                Inspectors were hired two (2) years ago, and have spent eighteen (18) months assessing the potential of the caves, incurring £1.8 million cost. The inspection cost has not been paid yet, but will be paid at the end of Year 1. As a result of their analysis, the required new equipment's capital cost is estimated at £18.4 million, payable before operations begin, with residual value of £6.4 million at the end of the project in four years' time, when there are no more diamonds left to mine in the caves. Due to the nature of the market as well as the remarkable properties of the caves, the diamonds are cut into 5 gram (5g) portions. This will give merchants the ability to have one 25 carat diamond block which they can refine into their customers' unique preferences.
                Estimates of revenues and costs arising from this project are:</p>

                <p>If the project goes ahead, sales of other existing products will be lost resulting in a loss of contribution of £15 million a year, over the life of the project. HD's accountant has informed you that the head office costs include £600,000 for managing this new project, and £300,000 which accounts for a fair apportionment of the total overheads of the company. A separate study has indicated that if the new equipment is bought, additional overheads, including equipment depreciation, arising from mining the diamonds would be £4.5 million a year. Once the project is finished, HD have been instructed by the local authorities to restore the surrounding environment to a satisfactory standard at least equal to that when it was discovered. It is estimated the cost for this will be £2.2 million, and is to be paid at the end of Year 5.
                Production would require additional working capital of £30 million immediately and from Year 2, it will increase each year by a further £5 million. The working capital is used until the end of the 4 years and is then no longer required to support the project. The business has a cost of capital of 8%.

                <p>Hospitablet Ltd manufactures small electronic scanning tablets for use in medical institutions. It is starting to prepare its budget for the six months commencing 1st July 2022. In each month in recent times, the company has sold 60 tablets per month at a price of £4,000 each. Tablets purchased by the company from its supplier cost £2,500 each. The company anticipates that at the beginning of July 2022, it will have an overdraft of £90,000.
                The company has just been advised that a new model of tablet has just been released and they will be receiving this latest model. This new model has 1.5 times more processing power than the current model. The purchase cost from the supplier is expected to increase by 10%, and the company has decided to sell these new tablets for 15% more than the current model is sold for. From the beginning of July, sales are expected to increase consistently at a rate of 30 machines each month through until the end of December 2022. Monthly operating costs in recent times have been £6,000 but it is anticipated that this amount will increase to £7,000 for July 2022, followed by additional increases in subsequent months. Operating costs are forecast as follows:</p>

                <p><strong>Week 6 (Relevant Costing):</strong> "When considering a proposed course of action, not all costs are relevant. Sunk costs (like older inspection fees) do not vary with the decision, so they should be excluded. Opportunity cost (lost contribution) should be included if that resource or time is redeployed."</p>

It does <em>not</em> consider the time value of money.
                Working capital is typically recovered at the end of the project… Restoration or disposal costs at the end of a project must be accounted for in the relevant year's cash flows. … The cost of capital is used to discount future cash flows to their present values."</p>

                Behavioral: extremely high targets can lead to demotivation or short-term 'gaming' of results. Conversely, too lenient targets create slack. Balanced, 'challenging but achievable' budgets often yield the best motivation."</p>

Also, full costing is better suited than marginal analysis for dealing with qualitative costs and benefits... so the answer always lies in the full cost.'

For outsourcing decisions, we need to consider which costs would be avoided if we outsourced (relevant costs). Fixed costs that would continue regardless should be excluded from the decision. Qualitative factors (quality control, reliability, strategic importance) must be considered alongside the quantitative analysis."</p>

                4. Variable cost: vary according to the level of activity.<br>

                <p>"Relevant cost conditions:<br><br>
                1. Must be a future cost (Historic cost is irrelevant).<br>
                2. Must vary with the decision. Opportunity cost: the value of the opportunity foregone… Sunk cost: cost already incurred; cannot be recovered."</p>

                • Worse than budget => adverse/negative variance<br>
                • Better than budget => favourable/positive variance<br>
                Some variances relate to volume, some to rate/speed causes… A 'favourable' variance does not necessarily mean that things are good; it may indicate overestimation in the budget.

It does <em>not</em> consider the time value of money.
                Working capital is typically recovered at the end of the project… Restoration or disposal costs at the end of a project must be accounted for in the relevant year's cash flows. … The cost of capital is used to discount future cash flows to their present values."</p>

            <h3>D. Budgeting (Week 8)</h3>
            
            <div class="excerpt">
                <p>"Budget: a short-term financial plan for the business… used for control and to motivate performance. If a limiting factor exists (e.g. materials or labor), the <em>entire</em> budget must revolve around that constraint.
                'Incremental budgeting' vs. 'Zero-base budgeting' are two contrasting approaches; each has pros and cons regarding accuracy, effort, time, and cost."</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="excerpt">
                <p>"Cash budget: we record inflows (sales receipts) and outflows (purchases, operating costs, tax, etc.) for each month. Payment timing is crucial, e.g., if suppliers offer credit from a certain month.
                Behavioral: extremely high targets can lead to demotivation or short-term 'gaming' of results. Conversely, too lenient targets create slack. Balanced, 'challenging but achievable' budgets often yield the best motivation."</p>

            <h3>E. Full vs. Marginal Costing (Weeks 2-4)</h3>
            
            <div class="excerpt">
                <p>"Traditional full recovery costing tries to share out overhead across units produced. However, for short-term decisions like outsourcing, <em>relevant cost</em> often includes <em>only</em> variable cost (and any avoidable fixed cost).
                Qualitative issues like reliability and quality are crucial but not specifically the domain of either full or marginal costing. They must be assessed separately.
                Marginal costing focuses on contribution and is often more suitable for short-term decisions (like special orders or partial outsourcing). Full costing can be more relevant when deciding on long-run pricing or total cost coverage."</p>

            <h3>F. Break-Even Analysis (Week 4)</h3>
            
            <div class="excerpt">
                <p>"Breakeven: Fixed costs ÷ (Unit selling price − Unit variable cost).
                Margin of safety = (Current sales − Breakeven) / Current sales.
                Limitations of CVP (BEP) analysis:<br><br>
                • Non-linear relationships between cost/revenue and volume…<br>
                • Possible step changes in fixed cost…<br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Section A: Longer, more complex questions (25 marks each)</li>
                    <li>Section B: Discussion/critique questions (25 marks each)</li>
                    <li>Section C: Calculation-heavy questions (25 marks each)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="conclusion-item">
                <h3>Exam Structure</h3>
                <p>Based on the 2021 paper, expect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 sections (A, B, C) with 2 questions each</li>
                    <li>Need to answer 1 from each section (3 questions total)</li>
                    <li>Each question worth 25 marks (75 marks total)</li>
                    <li>Mix of calculation and discussion components</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>In summary, the 2021 exam shows a clear pattern of testing both technical calculation skills and conceptual understanding. The most important topics are those that appear in both the 2021 and sample exams. Focus your revision on these areas, practice calculations, and develop your ability to critique statements about management accounting concepts.</p>
